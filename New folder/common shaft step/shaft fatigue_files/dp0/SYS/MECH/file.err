/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 16.2      BUILD 16.2      UP20150629       21:32:43

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.557   TIME= 21:32:52
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.822   TIME= 21:32:52
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.633   TIME= 21:32:53
 Material number 28 (used by element 54064 ) should normally have at     
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.363   TIME= 21:32:55
 Maximum contact stiffness 1.776912733E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.379   TIME= 21:32:55
 Too many nodes 6076 are included in the force-distributed-surface       
 constraint identified by real constant set 83.  This may greatly        
 affect solver performance.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.424   TIME= 21:32:56
 Too many nodes 11895 are included in the force-distributed-surface      
 constraint identified by real constant set 85.  This may greatly        
 affect solver performance.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      53.150   TIME= 21:33:32
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UY   
 degree of freedom of node 65056) which may indicate a numerically       
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.
